# PayPal Integration Guide for ExpenseEase

## Overview

This document explains how to fully integrate PayPal into the ExpenseEase application for real-time payment processing between users.

## Prerequisites

1. **PayPal Business Account**:
   - Create a business account at [PayPal Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/)
   - Verify your business identity

2. **Create Developer App**:
   - In the PayPal Developer Dashboard, navigate to "Apps & Credentials"
   - Create a new app to obtain Client ID and Secret

## Integration Steps

### 1. Set Up PayPal SDK

Replace the placeholder in `src/components/PayPalIntegration.tsx` with your Client ID:

```html
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&currency=USD"></script>
```

### 2. API Keys Management

Store your API keys securely:
- In development: Use environment variables (.env file)
- In production: Use secure environment variables in your hosting platform

```
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
PAYPAL_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### 3. Implement PayPal Payment Flow

The ExpenseEase application already contains the basic structure for PayPal integration:

1. When a user clicks "Pay with PayPal", we create a PayPal order
2. The user is redirected to PayPal's secure authentication
3. After payment approval, PayPal sends a webhook notification
4. Our app updates the expense status as paid

### 4. Testing

PayPal provides sandbox accounts for testing:
- Use sandbox.paypal.com for testing payments
- Create test accounts in the PayPal Developer Dashboard
- Make test payments between accounts

### 5. Security Considerations

- Never expose your Client Secret in client-side code
- Validate all payment webhooks on your server
- Implement CSRF protection for payment operations
- Set up fraud protection through PayPal's tools

## Venmo Integration

If you want to add Venmo (owned by PayPal):

1. Enable Venmo in your PayPal Business account
2. Add the `venmo: true` parameter to your PayPal SDK script
3. Users will see Venmo as a payment option when available
