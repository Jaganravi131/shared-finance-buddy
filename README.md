## API Integration

### PayPal Integration

ExpenseEase uses the PayPal SDK for payment processing. To configure:

1. The app uses a client ID for authentication.
2. Payments are processed through PayPal's checkout system.
3. Transaction records sync back to ExpenseEase to update balances.

```javascript
// PayPal Configuration Example
const PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";

// Initialize PayPal SDK
const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = `https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=${PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID}&currency=USD`;
script.async = true;
document.body.appendChild(script);
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual PayPal Client ID.

### OCR Receipt Scanning

The receipt scanning feature uses OCR technology to extract expense details:

1. The app captures an image of the receipt.
2. The image is processed to extract text and data.
3. Extracted information is used to pre-fill expense details.
